# Promotion Workflow

This file describes the low-effort distribution flow for Apartment Survival Kits.

## Current Strategy

For every strong article, create a small promo pack:

- 3 Pinterest-ready vertical PNGs.
- Pinterest bulk upload CSV rows.
- Pinterest title and description copy.
- 20-30 second short video script.
- Fiverr brief for cheap batch editing.
- Reddit angle for manual, non-spam replies.

Pins should link to the article page, not directly to Amazon. The article page contains the Amazon affiliate links and disclosure.

## Folder Structure

```text
promo/
  PINTEREST_LEDGER.csv
  pinterest-upload-next.csv
  pinterest-bulk-upload.csv
  article-slug/
    pins/
      pin-01.png
      pin-02.png
      pin-03.png
    pinterest-upload-next.csv
    pinterest-bulk-upload.csv
    pinterest-copy.md
    short-video-script.md
    fiverr-brief.md
    reddit-angle.md
```

The static site build copies `promo/` into `docs/promo/`, so images become public after GitHub Pages publishes.

Example:

```text
https://apartmentsurvivalkits.com/promo/dark-apartment-lighting/pins/pin-01.png
```

## Pinterest Bulk Upload

Use a Pinterest business account. It is free unless ads are used.

Upload this file for the next batch:

```text
promo/pinterest-upload-next.csv
```

`promo/pinterest-bulk-upload.csv` is the full generated archive. Do not upload it repeatedly, because it includes pins that may already be on Pinterest.

The CSV points to public image URLs on the site. Push the site before uploading the CSV, otherwise Pinterest cannot fetch the media.

Each Pin row needs a unique destination URL. When publishing multiple variants for the same article, use UTM parameters so Pinterest does not reject rows with `Duplicate Pin link`:

```text
?utm_source=pinterest&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=bulk_promo&utm_content=article-slug-pin-01
```

## Pinterest Ledger

`promo/PINTEREST_LEDGER.csv` is the memory file for Pinterest.

Status values:

- `ready`: generated but not exported yet.
- `exported`: included in `pinterest-upload-next.csv`; waiting for manual upload confirmation.
- `uploaded`: Pinterest accepted the pin.
- `published`: pin is live and no longer only scheduled.
- `error`: Pinterest rejected the row and it needs fixing.
- `hold`: intentionally paused.

When Pinterest accepts an upload, update the corresponding rows from `exported` to `uploaded`. If Pinterest returns errors, keep those rows as `error` or paste the error into chat so Codex can update the ledger.

The generator excludes `uploaded`, `published`, and `hold` rows from `pinterest-upload-next.csv`. It keeps `ready`, `exported`, and `error` rows in the next upload file until they are confirmed or paused.

Because Pinterest can reject duplicate destination links, every Pin variant uses a unique UTM-tagged article URL. The user still lands on the same article, but Pinterest and Analytics see a unique URL.

If the Pinterest scheduler is already near its future-pin limit, leave `Publish date` blank in the next upload CSV so pins publish immediately, or upload smaller batches manually.

Recommended boards:

- `Renter-Friendly Fixes`
- `Small Kitchen Organization`
- `Moving Day Checklists`
- `Small Apartment Storage`
- `No-Drill Apartment Ideas`

## Disclosure

Pinterest descriptions should include a clear disclosure such as `#ad` when the linked page contains affiliate links. The Pin links to the article, and the article includes the Amazon Associate disclosure.

## Build Commands

Generate promo assets:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-promo-assets.ps1
```

Rebuild site:

```powershell
node .\scripts\build-site.js
```

If normal Node is unavailable, Codex can use its bundled Node runtime.
